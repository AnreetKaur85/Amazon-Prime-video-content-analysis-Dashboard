# 🎬 Amazon Prime Video Content Analysis Dashboard  

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Streaming platforms like Prime Video host thousands of movies and TV shows across various genres, countries, and release years. However, analyzing this content at scale becomes a challenge due to the sheer volume and diversity of data.

**Key Challenges:**
- Identifying trends in genre popularity and release timelines  
- Understanding viewer age rating distributions  
- Evaluating global content distribution
